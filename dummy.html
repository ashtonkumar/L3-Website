        <p>Projects
            Our team of design engineers predominately focus on large to small residential building designs. We
            have completed numerous projects by offering solutions from the ground up. Our clients have always
            appreciated our project team’s technical capability and flexibility to deal with changes in scope while
            managing construction challengers by using alternative construction methodologies or innovative
            products. Several of our recent projects are shown below which are currently in the construction phase.</p>
